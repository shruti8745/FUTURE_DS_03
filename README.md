# 🎓 Student Event Feedback Analysis using Clustering
## 📌 Project Overview 

This project focuses on analyzing student event feedback data to uncover satisfaction patterns and meaningful insights. Using data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and clustering techniques, the project identifies trends in student responses and groups similar feedback to help stakeholders improve future events.

The analysis is performed in Google Colab using Python libraries for data manipulation, visualization, sentiment understanding, and machine learning.

## 🎯 Objectives

Clean and preprocess student feedback survey data

Analyze feedback trends and satisfaction patterns

Apply clustering (K-Means) to group similar student responses

Visualize insights to support data-driven decision making

Suggest improvements based on discovered patterns

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Google Colab)

Pandas & NumPy – Data cleaning and manipulation

Seaborn & Matplotlib – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – K-Means clustering

Text Analysis (basic sentiment indicators)

CSV data (Google Forms survey responses)

## 📂 Dataset

Source: Student feedback collected via Google Forms

Format: CSV

Data includes:

Event-related feedback

Satisfaction indicators

Multiple feedback attributes

🔄 Project Workflow

Data Loading

Imported CSV file into Pandas DataFrame

Data Cleaning

Removed unnecessary index columns

Renamed and simplified column headers

Checked and handled null values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis

Heatmap visualization

Understanding relationships between feedback variables

Clustering Analysis

Applied K-Means clustering

Assigned cluster labels to feedback data

Grouped students based on similar feedback patterns

Visualization

Heatmaps and plots for better interpretation of clusters

## 📊 Key Insights

Student feedback can be grouped into distinct clusters based on satisfaction patterns

Clustering helps identify:

Highly satisfied student groups

Moderately satisfied groups

Areas needing improvement

Visual analysis supports quick understanding of feedback trends

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

 **1** Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook

 Upload the feedback CSV file

 Run the notebook cells sequentially

 Review visualizations and cluster outputs

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Add advanced sentiment analysis (TextBlob / VADER)

* Increase dataset size for better clustering accuracy

* Integrate dashboard visualization (Power BI / Streamlit)

* Automate feedback classification
